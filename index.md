# H6751 Web and Text Mining

#### <center>NTU, WKW / Spring 2020</center>

## <font color='Red'>Course Description </font>

Nowadays, with the popularity of the Internet, there is a massive amount of text content available on the Web, and it becomes an important resource for mining useful knowledge. From a business and government point of view, there is an increasing need to interpret and act upon the large-volume text information. Therefore, text mining (or text analytics) is getting more attention to analyze text content on the Web. For instance, opinion mining and sentiment analysis is one of text mining techniques to analyze user-generated content on social media platforms.

This course is an introduction to text and web mining. It covers how to analyse unstructured data (i.e. text content) on the Web using text mining techniques. Students will learn various text mining techniques and tools both through lectures and hands-on exercises in labs. The course will also explore various usages of text mining techniques to real world applications. This course focuses on Web content mining, but not on Web structure and usage mining.

Students will learn following topics in the course:

* Principles and concepts of text and web mining.
* Various text mining techniques: Pre-processing for Text Mining, Text Categorization, Document Clustering, Information Extraction, and Opinion Mining & Sentiment Analysis.
* Practical use of text mining to real world applications, such as Text Message Spam Detection,
and Sentiment Analysis Systems analyzing public opinion towards various subjects, such as electronic gadgets, movies, stocks, etc., using social media content.

### Course Objectives:

At the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Appreciate the basics of text and web mining.
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of different text mining techniques.
- Work on practical problems that can be solved using text mining techniques.

### Prerequisites:

- The student has some aptitude for low-level logical thinking since lectures and labs will focus
on technical aspects of Text and Web Mining.
- Basic knowledge in **Python programing**.

### Reference Books

The following books are helpful, but not required. You will easily get these books from Internet.


- Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing *Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schütze*
- Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing *Yoav Goldberg*
- Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python : With Application to Understanding Data *John V. Guttag* 
- Applied Text Analysis with Python *Benjamin Bengfort* 

If you are not proficient in python, you may find [some tutorials](material/coding.md) helpful.

### Class Participation (5%)

We aapreciate everyone being actively involved in the class! There are serveral ways of earning participation credit, which is capped at 5%:

1. **Attending guest speakers' lectures**: In the semester, we have two invitied speakers, who are making a great efforts to come lecture for us. We do not want them speaking to a empty room. Your attendance at lectures with guest spearks is expected! In addition, it will be a very awesome chance for networking! You will get 1% per speark (total 2%) for attending.
2. **Attending two random lectures**: We are going to take attendance at two randonly-selected (non-guest) lectures in the quarter. Each is worth 1% (total 2%).
3. **Karma Point**: Any other act that improves the class, which instructors notics and deems worthy: 1%. 


### Individual In-class Assignment (20%)

We are going to have a 2 in-class assignments, which will cover programming. The details will be announced later. 

### Group Project (30%)

You are required to form a project group with 3-4 members. This is a text mining project where you collect your own sample text dataset (or use an existing dataset), and using text mining techniques and tools, build an interesting model / application that mines knowledge/information from the text dataset. Generally, the project scope is entirely up to you, but I suggest that you build a useful and interesting application. Then, write a project report explaining your methodology and presenting the results and present your work in class. The detailed information can be found [here](project/project.md).


- **Credit**:
  * Project report (15%) 
  * Project presentation (15%)

### Final Exam (45%)

We will prepare a review session before the final exam.
