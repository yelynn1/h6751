## Final Project


As a significant portion of your grade, the Course Project provide you the chance to flex your newly acquired skills toward an application of your choosing. What is more, people from different background are encouraged to form a team. 

This is a group project (the size of each group will be announced later). All team members will receive the same grade. This project will account for 30% of the overall grade. Please e-mail the lecturer your project title by the project title selection due date. Include the names of team members in the message.

This is a text mining project where you collect your own sample text dataset (or use an existing dataset), and using text mining techniques and tools, build an interesting model / application that mines knowledge/information from the text dataset. Generally, the project scope is entirely up to you, but I suggest that you build a useful and interesting application. Then, write a project report explaining your methodology and presenting the results.

You may conduct investigative analysis on any one of the following topics related to text mining:
* Text classification
* Text clustering
* Opining mining and sentiment analysis
* Information Extraction
* Other topics are possible with consent from the instructor.

1. Report Submission: 
  - Must include a bibliography listing all references (including URLs, if any) cited
  - Length: 8-10 pages.
  - Formatting: The use of 10-point Times font is mandatory. The formatting should be referred to [ICML style](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/StyleAuthorInstructions). The word template could be found [here(). The latex template is provided in the [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/icml-2019-submission-template/vkqjjvzjvhdc). 
  - Only require the soft copy. The soft copy should be submitted through Turnitin. 
  - Create your github project page that containing dataset and code used by the project. And put your github page link in your report.

2. Group Presentation: 
  - Each team will be asked to conduct a 15/20-minute presentation on their project work. This will be followed by a 5 minute question-and-answer session to allow for clarification by students and the lecturer. Schedules for the presentation will be announced later.
  - Every teammember is required to present.

Note that reports and required files/documents handed in after the due date will be marked down by 10% per day.
